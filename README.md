# Presidential precinct data for the 2020 general election

The Upshot scraped and standardized precinct-level election results from around the country, and joined this tabular data to precinct GIS data to create a nationwide election map. This map _does not_ have full coverage for every state: data availability and caveats for each state are listed below, and statistics about data coverage [are available here](https://int.nyt.com/newsgraphics/elections/map-data/2020/national/precincts-with-results-statistics.json). We are releasing this map's data for attributed re-use under the MIT license in this repository.

The GeoJSON dataset can be downloaded at: https://int.nyt.com/newsgraphics/elections/map-data/2020/national/precincts-with-results.geojson.gz

Properties on each precinct polygon:

- `GEOID`: unique identifier for the precinct, formed from the five-digit county FIPS code followed by the precinct name/ID (eg, `30003-08` or `39091-WEST MANSFIELD`)
- `votes_dem`: votes received by Joseph Biden
- `votes_rep`: votes received by Donald Trump
- `votes_total`: total votes in the precinct, including for third-party candidates and write-ins
- `votes_per_sqkm`: total votes divided by the area of the precinct, rounded to one decimal place
- `pct_dem_lead`: `(votes_dem - votes_rep) / (votes_total)`, rounded to one decimal place (eg, `-21.3`)

_Due to licensing restrictions, we are unable to include the 2016 election results that appear in our interactive map._

Please contact dear.upshot@nytimes.com if you have any questions about data quality or sourcing, beyond the caveats we describe below.

## General caveats

- Where possible, we used official precinct boundaries provided by the states or counties, but in most cases these were not available and we generated boundaries ourselves, using L2 voter-file points to guess the precinct for each census block group; this results in _generally accurate_ precinct boundaries, but can be rough in no- or very-low-population places like business parks or uninhabited rural land.
  - Because of this, spatially joining our precinct GeoJSON to other geographic datasets will most likely yield less-than-ideal output.
- Some of the results we gathered are unofficial/uncertified, since the certified tabulations hadn't yet been released at time of gathering.
- A very small portion of the tabular precinct results (roughly 0.01%) could not be joined to the precinct boundaries, and thus these results are not present in the GeoJSON.
- A few areas, such as rural Maine, Vermont and Hawaii, contain no voters, and those polygons are excluded from the GeoJSON.

## State-by-state data availability and caveats

|symbol|meaning|
|:----:|:------|
|✅|have gathered data, no significant caveats|
|⚠️|have gathered data, but doesn't cover entire state or has other significant caveats|
|❌|precinct data not usable|
|❓|precinct data not yet available|

Note: One of the most common causes of precinct data being unusable is "countywide" tabulations. This occurs when a county reports, say, all of its absentee ballots together as a single row in its Excel download (instead of precinct-by-precinct); because we can't attribute those ballots to specific precincts, that means that _all_ precincts in the county will be missing an indeterminite number of votes, and therefore can't be reliably mapped. In these cases, we drop the entire county from our GeoJSON.
